# GSPCore - OpenGSP Core Library

GSPCore is a cross-platform library that provides all the functionality you might want to build performant, responsive and efficient applications. It can be used with a variety of higher-level libraries such as **UniversalUI**, but is designed in such a way as to be the only dependency necessary for a significant selection of functionality.

It is written internally in C++, but uses a C-style interface so that it can be called from nearly any language.
