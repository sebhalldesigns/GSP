# GSP - OpenGSP

A collection of modular libraries for modern application development.

OpenGSP prioritizes the following concepts:
- **simplicity** - OpenGSP tries to make each module as simple as possible, while fulfilling it's function well. This simplifies development and maintenance, reduces binary size, and improves ease of use.
- **efficiency** - OpenGSP tries to achieve the highest efficiency available to modern devices, embracing concepts such as parallel computing and GPU rendering.
- **modularity** - OpenGSP is developed as a set of distinct modules, which can be included where necessary. This gives developers the ability to include only the modules they require, reducing binary size and duplicated imports.

OpenGSP has the following additional targets:
- **cross-platform deployment** - OpenGSP is a platform independant system, targeting all modern operating systems including Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS, Android and others including BSD and VisionOS.
- **bidirectional compatibility** - both forwards and backwards compatibility are targeted. As an example, an app compiled with OpenGSP on Windows 11 should run with no modifications on a Windows 7 system. 
- **zero-dependency** - no libaries are required for using OpenGSP components, except where unavoidable (such as Win32).
